Touch Typing has an advantage (?)

In six months, imagine you failed your goal
write the story of how it happened
give yourself about 15m
repeat for different goals/over time(?)

remember: small habits add up over time to big changes
(duh, but be mindful that the little things add up, or down)

Layers of behavior change
outer: result
middle: actions
inner: mindset

mindest: think about who you want to be
not HAVE, BE
what type of person loses 40 lbs
identity is "repeated being"
you are  what you do repeatedly
everytime you do something, you are that
if you paint, you are a painter

Zeigarnik effect?
 The tendency to experience intrusive thoughts about an objective that was once pursued and left incomplete
 You think about things you didn/t finish
 (the cult of DONE applies here!) 
  
The Eisenhower Box (cult of done precusor)
  		| Urgent     | Not Urgent
________________|________________________________
Important	|  Do	     |  Decide/Schedule
UnImportant	|  Delegate  |  Delete

Decide: this is the stuuf you want/need to do, but don/t
Delegate: this can be to another person, automation, or to another time. these are the time suckers
Delete: this tend to hang on because they WERE important, but really aren't anymore

We are more like roses than trees. We3 must be pruned, sometimes, even good buds
a Good use versus a Great use of time. these tasks can be the hardest to let go. a #6 priority, versus a #2 or #3. but it/s very important

Four Stages of Behavior/Habits
1. Trigger
2. Desire
3. Action
4. Reward

1. Notice, Prompt/Queue Desire
 I see a cookie, I want to eat it
 I wake up, I want to get up (goal)
Cold and Hot triggers
Hot is right away
Cold is delayed

 Trigger T-Chart exercise
List of things you do:
 eat, brush teeth, get out of bed, drink, etc
List of things that happen:
 traffic light turns green, sun comes up, et.c
Then pair a trigger (happens) to a new habit (action)

be detailed, a hundred in step one is good
eg. Meditate: when i make coffee, i meditate 60 sec
the more specfic the trigger, the better.
eg. "when i close my laptop for lunch, i do 15 pushups"
habit stack: start coffee, meditate for 60s, write to-do list for the day, add ice to coffee, do pushups, drink coffee and sit down

2. Desire, 
there is a differemce between wanting something and liking something 
visualization. imagine a mess desk (or find one), you can't touch it. visualizie how you'd clean it. in exacting detail. how it would look, how it would feel (sound and smell too). imagining it vividly creates desire.
the more clear the outcome you picture, the stronger the desire
implementation intention. state the specfics of what youre going to do
eg "During the next week, I will partake in 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on Monday, at 1:30pm in the office"
When and where, specifically
explicity state when where and how you will implement new habits

3. Action
the should be small
no, smaller
like, really really small
the smaller, the more effective
the 2 min rule
if less then 2, do it now
new behaviors, initial action must be 2m, or less
any habit action can be started in 2m
make it so easy you can't say no
take running, the goal isn't to run, but to put on your shoes and go outside, and close the door
it's okay to fail at that point, but you want to make momentum
 if you are doubting, then just do the trigger (see the visualization above) and stop
take exercise, you go in to workout, piddle about for 5 min, then LEAVE. you CANNOT WORKOUT FOR THE FIRST WEEK (4-6 in the example given)

-->>Goal: get up and exercise. Trigger: B's 6:30 alarm. Action: get a sip of water from the sink. Upper limit: exercise for 90ish min

4. Rewards
immediate rewards are more valued over long-term rewards (duh)
bad habits tend to have immediate reward, and the bad is small
Identity based habits have an edge here. 
eg, being a person who exercises, exercising is the rewards
4a Failure
Abandon all or nothing (duh)
1 out of 7 is better than 0 of 7. small steps
make If-Thens that take failures and make them triggers
planning to fail is not expecting to fail
"never miss twice" the idea is to get back to the habit asap

5. environment
choice architucture: design for laziness
"I have never seen a person consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment"
DEISGN TO MAKE THE DEFAULT OPTIONS THE BETTER OPTIONS, MAKE THE BAD (UNDESIRABLE ONES) more difficult to attain

6. Feedback
tied to reward
paper clip strtategy:
a guy took two cups, put 120 clips in one, then for every call (fundamental) he made, he moved a clip.
measurable and tracking metrics
"what is measured, is managed"
Seinfeld strategy
"don't break the chain"
each day, make a paper chain link when you do the fundamental task, connect them, and don't break the chain, never miss twice
mark on a year calander perhaps
taped shoulder (posture)
 at the beging of the day, he taped himself in good posture, when he slouched, the tape pulled, and he remembered, and corrected

small actions add up
cut out stuff
you can only do 1 or 2 things at the higheest level
overcoming imposter: do it daily (show up)
habits feel wrong or bad to strat, this is normal. keep at it, and it will be normal, or good
the goal of this workout is to be better for the next workout
work hard enough to builod yourself up, not to  failure/burnout
consistency over duration
the goldilocks rule: not too hard, not too easy. a task should have some challenge but not overwhelm. easy enough to be fun, but not boring
"normal +1"
focus on one thing at a time
the more repeated, the better off a habit is, aim for automatic habits
evidence of identity bolsters the identity. eg, if you have many many papers written, you are more likely to think of yourself as a writer
sometyhings are within your power, some are not. do not confuse which is which
 step back and see what is something in your control
 eg tennis, you control you, not your oppent. you cannot change your opponent
rewardds: start with a reward, after some time (4-6wk) thenremove the reward
alternative: going to gy6m, with milksahke reward is contradictory, have rewards that don't counter the habit
anchor task: thing MUST happen, organize around that (school starts at 10a)
