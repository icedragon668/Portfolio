        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><img src="assests/images/dragon.jpg" />
            You may have already gathered my name. But, I hate it. The story behind 'why' is long, a bit depressing,
            and ultimatley boring. That said, I now go by 'Kori'. You may also notice my e-mail and other usernames are
            all 'icedragon668'. There is a connection between them!</p>
        <p>Way back in middle school, we were first asked to pick an e-mail as part of a computer class. They told us
            that picking a number would help ensure that we would be able to keep the same username as we moved to
            differnt sites. They were right. 'Icedragon' isn't exactly orginal. But tacking that '668' joke on the end
            makes it pretty unique. Do you know that one? '668' is the Neighbor of the Beast.</p>
        <p>Anyways, 'what does that have to do with your name?' you may ask. Well 'K≈çri' is 'Ice' in Japanese!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unrelated, but have you ever wondered why '42' is the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything? There
            are plenty of theories, but mine is that '42' in binary is 101010, which is ASCII for '*' the wildcard. It
            is, in a very literal sense, everything.</p>
