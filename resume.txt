I am a learning driven programmer. 
 I am a lifelong learner, motivated to learn new technology, languages, and even workplace paradigms. Strengths include JS, Express, Node, React, and SVG with an inclination towards animation. I have a passion for game design and development. With previous experience in team management and as a paramedic, I have developed an ability to work in fast-paced environments while effectively managing priorities.
