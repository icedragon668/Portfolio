// older statement
"A jack of all trades and master of none, but better than a master of one."
Robert Greene used it to disparage William Shakespeare. I take it as a compliment to be included in such company.
 My own experience is widely varied, in no small part because I simply enjoy learning and experiencing.
And I plan to keep at it.
